# Podaris QGIS

A QGIS plugin for interacting with projects on the Podaris platform.

## What is Podaris?

Podaris is a real-time collaboration platform for planners, engineers, policymakers, and public stakeholders.

Create multi-modal transport networks and analyze their costs and benefits. Share these models with internal or external collaborators, ensuring that they are vetted and validated from every possible angle.

High-level analytical tools give an immediate understanding of travel-time and spatial connectivity.
